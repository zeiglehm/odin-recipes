    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Garlic butter baked salmon</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fingerling potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salmon fillets</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>asparagus </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 400°F | 200°C. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together potatoes with the oil, 1/2
            tablespoon of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread out in an even layer and roast for
            15 minutes until they're just starting to soften and brown.</li>
        <li>Push potatoes to one side of the sheet pan and arrange salmon down the centre. Rub salmon evenly with 1 1/2
            tablespoons of the minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of parsley. Add the asparagus to the other side of the
            pan. </li>
        <li>Combine 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the melted butter together and pour the mixture over the
            salmon and asparagus. Season everything with the remaining salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Return to oven and continue baking until the potatoes are golden and fork-tender and the salmon is opaque
            throughout, (about 10 minutes). Optional: broil in the last 2 minutes for charred edges. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining butter, garlic and lemon juice with the wine (or chicken
            stock). Serve with the salmon, veggies and lemon slices!</li>
    </ol>
